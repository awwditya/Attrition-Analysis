Attrition analysis using Power BI

Welcome to the Attrition Analytics Dashboard! This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of employee attrition within the organization, helping stakeholders understand key metrics and identify trends related to employee turnover. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include average salary, average years worked, attrition rate, and attrition breakdowns by age and job role. The average salary KPI helps in understanding compensation trends and comparing them against attrition rates, while the average years worked provides insights into employee tenure and its relationship with attrition. The attrition rate is a crucial metric that indicates the overall turnover within the organization. Additionally, the attrition by age and attrition by job role KPIs help identify specific groups and positions with higher turnover rates, enabling targeted retention strategies.

The dashboard is composed of several components. The summary view offers a high-level overview of key metrics and trends in employee attrition, while the detailed analysis breaks down attrition data by various dimensions such as age, job role, and department. The comparative analysis component allows for the comparison of attrition metrics across different segments to identify patterns and anomalies. Users can utilize interactive filters to drill down into specific data segments and perform trend analysis to identify historical trends and predict future attrition patterns. Benchmarking against industry standards is also possible to evaluate organizational performance.

This Attrition Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to help you understand and manage employee turnover effectively. By leveraging the insights provided, you can develop strategies to enhance employee retention and improve overall organizational health.
